Big idea: Use a tuple to keep track of levels i.e

(node,level)

Use a dequeue to keep track of nodes -> Append root,0

Driver logic is 

Pop the queue
If node is none, continue
If node is on current level, append value and continue
Else the node is a next level node
Update the current level and add this current node to the list of current nodes

Add the children of the current node as next level nodes to the queue

(Don't forget to add the nodes to the answer properly!)
