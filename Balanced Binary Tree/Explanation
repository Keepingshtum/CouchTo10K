We need to keep track of subtree heights... which we do by 1+ max of left/right

Base case is return 0 on leaf nodes

Traversal is the regular recursive approach.

The breaking case is if left - right absval is >1 , we return -1

AND if we see -1 in left or right, we return -1 until we break out of the recursion

Return a bool on whether our util function returns -1 or not.
