Either just use collections.Counter.most_common(1)[0][0]

or Assume first elem is our guess, keep incrementing/decrementing count based on match/no match

Take the current elem as next guess if count is down to 0 (this is Boyer-Moore Algorithm)


Other approaches - Sort then check middle (n/2,n/2-1)
Just pick elements at random and then verify whether they occur more than n/2 times - worst case 0(infinity) but expected case is O(n)
