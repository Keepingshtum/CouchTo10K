Approach 1: 

Sort the array, then use 3 pointers
i from 0->len(nums)-2
left = i+1
right = len(nums)-1

while left<right,
check nums[i]+nums[l]+nums[r] == 0

Use a set to see if the solution has already been added - if not seen, add to set

shift pointers as normal using the sum > target logic

return set as the result
