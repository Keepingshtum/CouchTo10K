Brute force:
Compare n elements to each of the n elements and see if they sum up
Time: O(n2)
Space: O(n1)

One Pass Hash:
Instead of checking for duplicates, just proceed forward and check backwards to see if we have complement already.
Just add the number to the hash in (Value:Index) format and check at the end.
Return the pair as an array and throw exception otherwise.
