We need to add Even counts of letters to get the longest palindrome, i.e 4 as, 2bs...

So if a letter count is even, we add it directly to largest length. If it's odd, we add count -1

To check whether there were leftoveers, check whether the largest palindrome is an anagram of the string itself by comparing lens

If so, return len. else return Largest+1
